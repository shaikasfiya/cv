  <h1>The Biryani Anthem</h1>
  <p>Come on, let’s go grab a late night dinner I’m hungry.<br />
     Come with me, we gotta move fast now<br />

Don’t bother, asking me what I’ll order,<br />
 only one thing I wanna eat now<br />

And I’m singing like<br />

Oh, tonight I’ll have a lot because<br />
 my Muslim friend is getting married<br />

Pile on that rice and meat<br />

I’m crazy hungry don’t mind me<br />

On Eid, we’ll be back for more<br />


Be careful not to eat an elaichi<br />
Come on now, time to eat<br />
Come, come on now, time to eat<br />
Um…mmm…mmm…<br />

Biryani’s my favorite food<br />
And I’m sure you will like it too<br />
Although my weight is 92<br />
I’m in love with Biryani<br />
One is not enough, I’ll have two<br />
And a side of Kababs too<br />
Veg Biryani’s not Biryani<br />
I’m in love with Biryani<br />
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I<br />
Ambur, Hyderabadi<br />
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I<br />
Mughlai, Bengali<br />
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I<br />
Malabar, Lakhnawi<br />
Eat with your hands not with a spoon<br />
Biryani’s my favorite food
<br />
One weekend, I was just chillin’ with friends and <br />
we were watchin’ Game of Thrones.
<br />
Biryani is coming.
<br />
The time is 1:50, so lets order on swiggy or<br />
 screw it let’s just get out of home
<br />
We talk for hours sittin’, ’bout the mutton and chicken and<br />
 how mummy cooks better than this
<br />
Leave and get in an auto, then rate on zomato and <br />
get th auto-driver also a plate, and I’m singing like
<br />
Oh, it’s my choice of drug<br />
A pot of awesomeness made just for me<br />
How come there’s no leg piece?<br />
Because this is prawn Biryani<br />
Dinner, breakfast lunch or brunch<br />
Grab on my plate and put that Biryani<br />
Don’t need coke or weed<br />
When you got Biryani<br />

My favorite Biryani place<br />
Is where I’ll take my Tinder Date<br />
Because at least I’ll get a good meal<br />
If I don’t get lucky<br />
Last night you were in my room<br />
And now my bedsheet smells like you<br />
How about you and me Netflix & Chill<br />
With a pot of Biryani<br />

Come on, eat Biryani, come on<br />
Come on, eat Biryani, come on<br />
Ambur, Hyderabadi<br />
Come on, eat Biryani, come on<br />
Come on, eat Biryani, come on<br />
Mughlai, Bengali<br />
Come on, eat Biryani, come on<br />
Come on, eat Biryani, come on<br />
Malabar, Lakhnawi<br />

Every day eating at some place brand new<br />

Biryani’s my favorite food</p>
